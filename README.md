# bevygate

A Keycloak theme for login (and affiliated) pages with common Bevy theme.

## Releases

Each GitHub release is generated on top of new Git tag, which is pushed to the repository.

The release and the tarball is generated automatically by GitHub Action (see [`/.github/workflows/release.yml`](/.github/workflows/release.yml)).

The tag has to be in a format of `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`.

The proposed versioning scheme is currently [Zer0ver (0ver)](https://0ver.org/), since this is not a full release of Bevygate theme yet. After full release, e.g. 1.0, it is to be decided if you want to switch to [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) for example or stay on Zer0ver.
